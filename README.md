I'm a CSE student at **Presidency University**, passionate about building modern and scalable web applications.  
My core interest lies in the **MERN stack**, and I enjoy turning real ideas into real products.

I like understanding how systems work end-to-end — frontend design, backend logic, APIs, and databases.  
Every project is a chance to learn something new, and I chase that improvement every day.
